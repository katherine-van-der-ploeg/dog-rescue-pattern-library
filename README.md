name: "Loyal Rescue"
fontUrl: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700"
fonts:
  primary: |
    The primary typeface is a clean, but friendly typeface designed to work well with the bright colours and light friendly atmosphere of the website.

    As Roboto is the ONLY typeface used by the website, the different weights are what creates the hierarchy. Bold is used for headers (H1, and H2 respectively), Medium is used for sub-headers (h3 to H6), buttons and to highlight important text,
    Regular is for body copy and light is used for captions
colors:
  primary: |
    The primary colours are variations of a light cyan and chosen to represent the loyalty of the company to their rescued animals. Use them as the main colours for headers (or header backgrounds)
  secondary: |
    The accent colour is used to add some brightness to the website and the yellow is intended to represent the friendship and companionship being offered by Loyal Rescue. The accent colour can be used for buttons and any details such as bullets in the text.
  neutral: |
    To counteract the brightness and vivid primary and accent colours, all of the neutrals are greyscale. This ads some sophistication to the site while maintaining its friendly disposition. Neutrals are used for all body copy, sub headers, dividing lines and gradients.

At Loyal Rescue, we are dedicated to the animals that come into our care. When they arrive we work around the clock to get them the care and medical attention they require before they are placed in their foster homes.There, they are cared for like family until their forever home comes along. This is where you come in. The 20 minute long application must be filled out before you can visit with any of our animals and for good reason. Only a family that is as dedicated to their future friend as we are is going to be selected and if this pup is not a good fit, we promise we will find you one that is.
