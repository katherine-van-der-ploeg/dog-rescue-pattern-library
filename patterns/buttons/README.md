The buttons use variations of the primary and accent colours to compliment the text and design accents.

- The regular buttons are used for submission and for buttons required within the web-page
- The light buttons are used for navigation
- The ghost buttons are used for banners and as navigation hover

The font sizes can be messed with a bit to compliment the buttons hierarchy and background.
